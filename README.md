## Project Objectives Overview

The project dataset contain data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. After obtaining the project data set from:

write an R script called run_analysis.R which perform the following objectives:

    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the 
       average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
